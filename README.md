# Ecliptic Cycle (Moon Phases)
![Promo Art: Cosmic Clockwork](https://github.com/Extex101/link-images/blob/main/ecliptic_cycle_the_pale.gif?raw=true)
  - Due to engine limitations, the moon is eternally locked at 180 degrees from the sun.
  - A configuration that would produce a constant Lunar Eclipse.
  - This mod takes that idea and makes moon phases out of it. 
  - The moon rocks from side-to-side, in-and-out of the umbra of the earth.
